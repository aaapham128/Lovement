      Where To Start:
      <div>
        The first step to making a difference in your community is to start by mobilizing others.
        This means to prepare, educate, and organize the members in your community for active service in making a change in the world.
        You can do this by;
        <div>
          ~ Educating yourself
          <div>
            ~ Starting a club at your school
            <div>
              ~ Setting up meetings with your neighborhood members to educate and update them with current issues
              <div>
                ~ Using social media to your advantage
                <div>
                  ~ Volunteering at your local youth centers
        <div>
          As Barack Obama once said, " Change will not come if we wait for some other person, or if we wait for some other time.
          We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek."
        <div>
        </right>
      </h4>
